# LSP 

## npm setup

Many LSP servers are installed through `npm`:

* Install `npm`
* Configure `npm` prefix, like `npm config set prefix '$HOME/.local/'` (make sure
  directory exists)
* Add `$HOME/.local/bin` to path (in `.bashrc` or `fish_add_path $HOME/.local/bin`
  for fish)
* Install packages globally with `npm install PACKAGE -g`
